# Deployment Instructions for Render.com

## Current Status
- ✅ TikTok: Working
- ✅ PornHub: Working  
- ❌ YouTube: Stuck at "Connecting to server..." (yt-dlp ENOENT error)
- ❌ YouTube Music: Same issue as YouTube

## Problem Identified
The issue is that yt-dlp cannot be executed on Render.com due to `spawn yt-dlp ENOENT` error.

## Files Updated
1. **server.js** - Added yt-dlp path verification and better error handling
2. **render.yaml** - Enhanced build process with yt-dlp verification
3. **package.json** - Clean dependencies (no postinstall script)

## What to Upload to Render.com
Upload these files to your Render.com repository:

### Core Files (REQUIRED)
- `server.js` ✅ (Updated with yt-dlp path checking)
- `package.json` ✅ (Clean dependencies)
- `render.yaml` ✅ (Enhanced build process)
- `index.html` ✅
- `script.js` ✅
- `style.css` ✅

### Optional Files
- `README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (this file)

## Expected Behavior After Deployment
1. **Build Process**: Render.com will download yt-dlp for Linux and make it executable
2. **YouTube Downloads**: Should work with ytdl-core (primary) and yt-dlp (fallback)
3. **Error Logging**: Better error messages if yt-dlp is missing

## If YouTube Still Doesn't Work
The issue might be that ytdl-core is also failing. In that case:
1. Check Render.com logs for specific error messages
2. The system will fallback to yt-dlp automatically
3. yt-dlp should work after the build process completes

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Test TikTok download ✅ (should work)
2. Test PornHub download ✅ (should work)  
3. Test YouTube download (should work with fallback system)
4. Check Render.com logs for any yt-dlp errors

## Support
If issues persist, check the Render.com build logs for:
- yt-dlp download success
- yt-dlp executable permissions
- yt-dlp version test results
